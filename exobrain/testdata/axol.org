* [#A] Motivation :refile:
** TODO [#B] I don't necessarily want to read everything found by 'scott alexander', but it's still interesting to run search to see the overlap between people?
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [2020-06-25 Thu 09:38]
:END:
** TODO why not hnrss?
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [2020-11-30 Mon 01:53]
:END:
it's very likely more convenient to use if you only want a few HN queries, and don't care about historic ones
** TODO why axol over rss bridges?
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [2020-12-05 Sat 03:56]
:END:
rss is awesome! downsides
- might be trickier to do various post-filtering
- with axol, you can compare results across queries (user summary)
- can be used with promnesia maybe
** STRT motivation: I don't understand how google search alerts work. e.g. try on openbci query (see my old emails from google alert)
:PROPERTIES:

** TODO [#D] [2019-12-30 Mon 20:03] Ask HN: Do you still use RSS? | Hacker News :rss:toblog:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21913598
: I've just started using Feedbin about a month ago, and although my HN firehose feed is at like 1100 something, it definitely limits the rest of the HN feeds. The show and ask feeds are both stuck around 400 something.
** [#D] [2018-11-24 Sat 14:04] problems with diff approach
*** random errors, resulting in empty diff
*** small differences in output (e.g. google search)
*** not always interested in items disappearing from query

the downside -- having to keep the state :(
** [#C] [[http://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/1047228539156750336][TW]] at [2018-10-02 Tue 20:55] А кто-нибудь знает тулы типа https://t.co/EbpbNZWQFC , но чтобы туда можно было вбить грубо говоря любую поисковую кверю, или API (например reddit/github); и оно отслеживало результаты?
*** [2019-10-02 Wed 23:29] huh
** [#C] [2020-06-22 Mon 10:52] [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23018081][I feel the same. So many cool things I'd love to learn about, but not enough tim... | Hacker News]] :pkm:axol:

multiple small:

single db:

eh. sooo, there are no dupes even!! BS4 actually sees only 20 per page (pinboard still gives us '50' in the next url).
whereas chrome does show up 50 entries; but if you go to the second page they are gonna overlap.
