This is a test file

* a heading with example
TODO crap this doesn't work at the moment? crashes while it's trying to do org-export-get-reference
: #+begin_example
: i am an example
: #+end_example

- [ ] move individual data sources to files within the repo.. not even submodules, too much hassle
  if someone needs, they can just import axol.sources.src directly
- [ ] cleanup the json shit.. ideally use some proper library
- [ ] not sure what to do with RSS feeds.. but could start with HTML report generation
- [ ] query language:
  might be better to adopt
  service:sub:query
  e.g.
  pinboard:tag:whatever
  or
  github:some query
  not sure what to do with colons though.. but maybe think about this later. most won't support searching them anyway

* TODO [#C] thinking about query language

how it could look in adhoc mode
github:'scott alexander' twitter:'scott alexander'

in config, allow something nicer like
[twitter,github,reddit]:'scott alexander'

or [twitter,github,reddit, pinboard]:['scott alexander', 'quantified self']
pinboard:tag:scottalexander
