In my free time apart from the maintenance of my [physical shell](https://twitter.com/mspowahs/status/957995279092875264) I mostly enjoy building things (sadly, that only involves programming so far) and learning.
This blog will hopefully aid the latter!

Physically I'm currently based in London, UK.
