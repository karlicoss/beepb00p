* what about that?
one [[sidenote:][testing sidenote]]

- two {{{aside(test)}}}



* Motivation
At some point in my life I realized I didn't remember most of the books/papers/posts/videos I had consumed few years before. [[sidenote:][For brevity I'll just refer to all of this as 'content' further on]]


- I often struggle to describe my interests to new people I meet, and it's hard to guess what other people might be interested to know about you. This site could potentially serve as a rough idea of "what's on my mind" for other people to explore. {{{aside(see <a class='post-tag' href='./tags.html#extendedmind'>#extendedmind</a>)}}}
